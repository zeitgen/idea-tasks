# Contexts

A context is a set of files that are open in the editor. Contexts can be managed either in connection with [tasks](Tasks.md) or independently from them.

When you work on a task, the files that you open in the editor are part of the task's context. When you switch between tasks, you also switch between the corresponding contexts: all the files currently open in the editor are closed and a new set of files is opened instead. 

If necessary, you can manage contexts independently from any of your tasks. 

## What You Can Do

The following is a list of contexts-related commands. You can perform these commands either from the **Tools** | **Tasks & Contexts** menu or by using the corresponding keyboard shortcut.

- [Save](Contexts-saving.md) a context.
- [Load](Contexts-loading.md) a context.
- [Clear](Contexts-clearing.md) a context with `âŒ¥â‡§X`.
- [Remove](Contexts-removing.md) a context.
