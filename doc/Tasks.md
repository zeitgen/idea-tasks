# Tasks

A task is a named activity performed in IntelliJ IDEA. It can either be correlated with an issue in an issue tracker or represent an arbitrary self-defined activity not registered in a tracker.

Inside IDEA, a task is commonly associated a [context](Contexts.md), a [VCS branch][1] ![][ext] and a [changelist][2] ![][ext]. When you switch to another task, you automatically switch between those, as well.

Before you start working with tasks, make sure to perform the [initial configuration](Getting-started.md) steps to enable integration between IntelliJ IDEA and the issue tracker.

## What You Can Do

The following is a list of tasks-related commands. You can perform these commands from the **Tools | Tasks & Contexts** menu, the tasks drop-down list on the main toolbar, or by using the corresponding keyboard shortcut.

- [Open or create](Tasks-opening.md) a task by pressing `âŒ¥â‡§N`.
- [Switch](Tasks-switching.md) between the currently open tasks by pressing `âŒ¥â‡§T`.
- [Close](Tasks-closing.md) the current task with `âŒ¥â‡§W`.
- [Edit](Tasks-editing.md) a task.
- [Add the changelist](Tasks-add-changelist.md) for the task.
- [View the description](Tasks-viewing.md) of a task.
- [Remove](Tasks-removing.md) a task.
- [Analyze stacktrace][3] ![][ext] attached to the task.



> Explore the [tasks-related preferences][4] ![][ext] to customize your tasks-related workflow.
