# Working with Tasks and Contexts

IntelliJ IDEA provides task management capabilities that can help you organize your work and coordinate it with your team as part of the issue tracking procedure.

- With your project linked to the issue tracker, you can browse issues without leaving the editor.

- After choosing an issue to work upon, you can instantly open all the files related to it.

- When your work is finished, you can commit your changes and at the same time update the state of the issue in the tracker.

In IntelliJ IDEA, these activities are performed by means of **tasks** and **contexts**.

## What is a Task and a Context

- [Task](doc/Tasks.md) is an activity performed in IntelliJ IDEA, which can be correlated to a certain issue in the tracker.
- [Context](doc/Contexts.md) is a set of files opened in the editor, which can be managed in connection with a task or separately from it.

## Getting Started

Before you start working with tasks, make sure to perform the [initial configuration steps](doc/Getting-started.md) to enable integration between IntelliJ IDEA and your issue tracker.
